# osu-improvement-dashboard
A personal analytics dashboard for osu! that helps you understand how you’re actually playing (maps, mods, difficulty, accuracy, etc.) and gives feedback on your bad habits (e.g., retry spam, playing maps that are too hard, not challenging yourself enough). 

The app will:
- Pull data from the osu! API via ossapi
- Live capture plays from Tosu
- Store play data locally in SQLite
- Provide a simple interactive UI with Streamlit

## WORK IN PROGRESS
